# Heart_Disease_Classification
This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: 
Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published 
experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. 
It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.
# Dataset Details:
Age, Sex, Chest pain type (4 values), Resting blood pressure, Serum cholestoral in mg/dl, Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl, Resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2),
Maximum heart rate achieved, Exercise induced angina, Oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest,
the slope of the peak exercise ST segment,
number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy,
thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect,

The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values.

Model Best Suited: Logistic Regression (Supervised Learning Classification Model)
